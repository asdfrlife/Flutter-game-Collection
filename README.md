# 🎮 Flutter Game Collection

A growing collection of simple, fun, and beginner-friendly Flutter games.  
The goal of this project is to build small games whenever a new idea comes —  
each one added and updated inside this single repository.

This project helps me practice:
- Flutter UI
- Game logic
- State management
- Animations
- Clean code structure
- Publishing and maintaining GitHub projects
